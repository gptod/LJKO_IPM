# TPFA finite volume approximation of Wasserstein gradient flows.

Approximate solution of L2 Wasserstein gradient flows with finite volumes discretization and an interior point strategy
for the solution of the discrete optimization problem.
This code implements the scheme presented in: A. Natale, G. Todeschi, "TPFA finite volume approximation of Wasserstein gradient flows",
FVCA9 - International Conference on Finite Volumes for Complex Applications IX, 2020, Bergen, Norway.
